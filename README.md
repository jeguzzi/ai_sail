=======

This repository contains code that extends the [streaming example provided by Bitcraze](https://github.com/bitcraze/AIdeck_examples) with
  - an application-level UART protocol to exchange structured messages (and logging) between Crazyflie and GAP. GAP can also log to UART and Crazyflie can pass dynamic parameters to GAP;
  - dynamic configurations for the most important camera parameters, like format, fps, exposure and cropping;
  - streaming RAW images too, which works generally better than the default JPEG encoder, despite the higher bandwidth (> x15). For instance, it allows you to capture and stream 160 x 90 at about 60 fps;
  - streaming over JTAG and named pipes, which is much slower (1/6) than WiFi but convenient for debugging and in case you don't have NINA packaged with a GAP.
  - a client that accept RAW images too and another that republish the stream to ROS.

The repo is divided into 5 parts:
- [Video-stream] client (Python3),
- crazyflie: just the `aideck.c` driver and the autogenerated protocol to include in the firmware tree,
- gap: the complete firmware for GAP8,
- nina: the complete firmware for NINA,
- protocol: a Python3 script to generate C-code using Jinjia templates.

Please refer to the READMEs the related documentation and follow [the instruction](https://github.com/bitcraze/AIdeck_examples) to install the different toolchain, build and run the software.

The Crazyflie code works the latest firmware, the GAP code with the latest GAP SDK (3.6),
The NINA code with ESP_IDF 3.3.1.


The name is an homage to the fantastic AI-DECK, to which we just add a sail to navigate better and faster to perilous sees of robotics and machine learning research.
